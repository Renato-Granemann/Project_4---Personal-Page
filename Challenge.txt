PROJECT IDEA: Personal Portfolio Website with Central Navigation

Project Description:
Create a personal portfolio website that integrates all the HTML and CSS concepts you've learned. The website should have multiple pages connected through a central navigation hub. All key HTML elements (lists, tables, forms, images, semantics) and CSS concepts (box model, selectors, colors, units, text styling, dimensions, display properties) must be used.

Requirements:

1. Central Navigation:
- Create a fixed navigation bar or a central navigation hub (e.g., on the homepage, big links/cards leading to other sections).
- Use <nav> elements and semantic structure.

2. Homepage:
- Welcome text with headings, paragraphs, horizontal lines (<hr>).
- An image of yourself or a symbol (<img>).
- A quote or slogan in a block element.

3. About Me Page:
- Use text elements (<p>, <strong>, <em>, etc.).
- An image of a hobby.
- An unordered list (<ul>) of your interests.

4. Projects Page:
- List of your previous projects using an ordered list (<ol>).
- For one project: a table with:
  - Name
  - Technologies
  - Completion date
- Optionally: Link to GitHub or external sites with <a>.

5. Contact Page:
- A form (<form>) with:
  - Name (text field)
  - Email (input type "email")
  - Message (textarea)
  - Submit button (<button>)
- Style the form nicely.

6. Extras:
- Use CSS for:
  - Colors and color schemes
  - Consistent typography design
  - The box model for container styling
  - Layout with block and inline elements
  - Display properties (block, inline, flex or grid)
- Use various units (px, %, em, rem)
- Use borders (<border>) to separate sections
- Use <div> containers for structure

Optional - Advanced extensions:
- CSS animations on navigation hover
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- CSS Grid or Flexbox to center the navigation
- Basic form validation (e.g., required, pattern)

Suggested structure:
index.html         --> Homepage
about.html         --> About Me
projects.html      --> Projects
contact.html       --> Contact Form
style.css          --> Main stylesheet

Why this project is ideal:
- It integrates all the HTML elements you've learned.
- You practice CSS layouts and box model application.
- You apply semantic structure and form creation.
- It's practical: you'll really need a portfolio later!

Let me know if you want a folder structure example and base code for each page.
